&nbsp;

**1. Please summarize this report in your own words (up to 200 words).**


**2. Are the chosen questions interesting?** Yes.The report focused on investigating whether class sizes are associated with math performance while noting other sort of association might be possible. However, these "other" associations weren't pursued as they are beyond the scope of the project.

**3. Does the report show that the authors understand the data set?** Yes

**4. Can the proposed methods answer these questions?** Yes.

**5. Is the report well-organized and clearly written?** Yes, however some of the statements are somewhat unclear, e.g., the authors stated they provide a 99% Bonferroni confidence interval instead of a 99% $\it{family-wise}$ Bonferroni confidence interval

**6. Should the report be given extra credit?** I don't think so. 


**7. Please elaborate on your assessments and provide constructive feedback (no limit).** I believe, overall, the authors of the report did a good job.However, it would be a lot more better if the following are incoporated:

1. It was implicitly assumed that the missing values in the data set could be missing at random, but there wasn't any thorough statistical analysis carried out to buttress this claim.

2. Since these sort of project reports are geared towards making policies, it might augur well that some of the results presented by the authors are given in context of policy making. This would help policy makers understand the effect of whatever decisions they are inclined towards.

3.The writing style is sometimes unclear or not as precise as possible. Thus, the reader is left to fill in the gaps and might end up being unintentionally misinformed.

4. There seemed to be lack of consistency in the presentation of results, especially the tables. Some results are presented in an understandable and clean format while some are presented in raw R output. For example, the results of the one-way Anova and the Leveneâ€™s test for homoscedastic. The authors might want to spend some time extracting these results from the raw R output and restructuring it into neat and nicely formatted table.


**8. Please provide questions for authors to address during presentations.**

1. What are the necessary information that must be provided about the aides before the authors can make causal inferences?
2. If at all we are interested in investigating further, the effect of missing values on our analysis, how do we go about it?
